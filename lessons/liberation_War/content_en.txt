The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 was a historic fight for independence. Before this war, Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan. The people here were treated unfairly and wanted the right to speak their own language, Bangla, and govern themselves. On March 26, 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence.

The war lasted for nine long months. Brave freedom fighters, known as the "Mukti Bahini," fought against the Pakistani army with great courage. Farmers, students, and people from all walks of life joined the fight to save their motherland. They faced many hardships but never gave up hope.

Finally, on December 16, 1971, Bangladesh achieved victory. The Pakistani army surrendered, and a new independent nation was born on the world map. We celebrate this day as "Victory Day" or Bijoy Dibosh. It reminds us of the sacrifices made by millions of martyrs for our freedom.
