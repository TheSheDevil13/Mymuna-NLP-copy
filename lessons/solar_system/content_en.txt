The Solar System is our home in the galaxy. It formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust. At the very center sits the Sun, a massive star that provides light, heat, and energy to everything around it. The Sun’s gravity is so strong that it holds all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets in orbit.

There are eight main planets in our Solar System, divided into two groups. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are called terrestrial planets because they are made mostly of rock and metal. Earth is special because it is the only known planet with liquid water and life.

The four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are known as gas giants and ice giants. They are much larger than the inner planets and do not have solid surfaces. Jupiter is the largest planet, while Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings.

Beyond the planets, there are dwarf planets like Pluto, and millions of small rocky asteroids and icy comets. All these objects travel around the Sun in paths called orbits. Learning about the Solar System helps us understand our place in the universe!
